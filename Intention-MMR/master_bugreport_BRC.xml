<Sentence ID = "5.14"> 1) Although the underlying cause may be the same, the symptoms of the two bugs are very different.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.15"> 2) Since the description attached to bug 362539 does not include the symptoms of this bug, it does not properly include this reported problem.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.16"> 3) When users search for this problem, now that this bug is closed, they probably will not find this description. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.17"> Nor will they find bug 362539 since it does not include these symptoms at the top level. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.18"> Hence they will not find the circumvention.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.19"> 4) Therefore, please re-open this bug report.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.20"> 5) Please do not attempt to amend the description of bug 362539. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.21"> Please leave that decision, as well as that of closure, to one of the Bugzilla 'monitors'</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "9.1"> I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.2"> Have gimp assume a landscape or portrait orientation automatically depending on whether the rectangular area swept out by the user is wider or higher.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.3"> This might only be problematic when the aspect ratio was nearly, but not exactly square, but even here the user could control the proper aspect by exaggerating the motion in the larger of the two directions.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.4"> If a swap button is maintained as in 2.3.12, then register the initial point used to sweep out the rectangular area and use that as the anchor rather than the upper-left corner as is now used.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.5"> It is very likely that the first point selected by the user will be a desired point and this will not be the upper-left corner unless this happens to be where they started.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.6"> As I stated elsewhere, it would also be great if the aspect ratio was automatically set to the initial aspect of the image being loaded.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.7"> You might provide a \"lock\" button to force the current aspect ratio to be retained upon subsequent loading of images for those times when someone wants to crop a series of pictures to the same proportions.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.8"> Maybe the current Fix button could be a toggle that switched between \"Lock\" (lock the aspect ratio - current behavior) \"Set\" (automatically set the aspect ratio for each new image and then locks it) \"Auto\"(the Set behavior combined with the behavior suggested by Albert) or \"None\".</Sentence>
