<Sentence ID="6.1">i ve found the cause</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.2">actually this bug is a duplicate of 207003, the only difference is that dani gave me a real-life example</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.3">let me briefly explain what s happening: 1) using the guess button: the algorithm used when guessing the fuzz factor is quite simple: for each hunk try to match using a fuzz of 0 first before attempting to match with a 1 and finally 2</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.4">at each stage, shifting is tried as well before increasing the fuzz factor</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.5">in dani s patch there is a hunk which needs to applied with the fuzz equals 2</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.6">since the 2 became the global fuzz factor for all the hunks it s used with other hunks as well</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.7">the hunk which dani complained about was shifted up and applied with the fuzz equals 2, if the fuzz hadn t been used for that particular hunk it would be shifted down and applied without a fuzz</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.8">2) entering the value for the fuzz factor manually (greater than 2) using value greater than 2 results in ignoring all the context lines and applying a hunk according to it s location coordinates and calculated shifting</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="6.9">this is a tempting approach but it s very risky at the same time</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="10.1">well, to be more precise it s very risky for additions as we loose all the context for a hunk, so there is no way to verify if it s applied in the right position</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.2">for others (deletion, change) we can t rely on the context either as it s all gone, but at least we can check with the lines the hunk is made of</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.3">the situation is slightly different when we have context lines inside the hunk..</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.4">or context lines are just white spaces..</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="10.6">i ve been thinking about showing some kind of warning when the value entered (or guessed) can result in a hunk inserted at wrong position</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="11.1">i think there are a couple of things to consider here: 1) now that we are actually doing the fuzz factor properly, it is actually more risky then it was before</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.2">i wonder if a good strategy is to warn the user with a don t show me this again dialog to indicate that any match made with a fuzz factor needs to be looked at closely for acurracy</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.3">2) additions seem particularly risky since the context lines define the match</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.4">you definitely can t try mathing with a fizz factor greater than n-1 where n iis the number of context lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.5">perhaps we could scan the file for multiple matches when using a fuzz factor, and, if mutliple matches are found, fail the match and rely on the improved hunk compare viewer you are working on ;-) i also wonder if it would be possible to use a matching strategy on a per hunk basis that always tries with a fuzz of 0 first and then progresively increases the fuzz by 1 until either the max is reached or a match is found</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.6">that way, we would be sure to use context lines when they do allow a match and only start ignoring them for hunks that require it</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.1">kalle noticed that the kernel ' s kitl thread has a priority level of 131, and our thread was setting a priority level of 116 (0 is the highest priority)</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.8">the high-priority (132) process thread normally has a very low cpu user-time total (ie, it doesn ' t actually do much), and the main firefox thread (where we actually do almost everything) accumulates cpu user-time as it ' s used</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.9">but in the hang conditions, the high-priority thread accumulates cpu rapidly while all the other threads ' counters stay frozen</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.10">so, this very much looks like one thread is spinning on the cpu and starving everything else</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.1">i ' m not sure the exact situations in which this happens, i think it has to do with using multiple builds with the same profile, but i ' ve hit it three times in the past day</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.2">what ends up happening is that the _buildsortedenginelist pre-allocates an array of a certain size, then fills the engine in order from the storage file</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">if not all slots are full, then this._engines contains undefined items and iterating through the engine list later in the startup process fails, giving a " engine has no properties " error and a blank search dropdown</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">i guess this could have happened when i ran a build including the " use storage " patch, which created the db, and then used an older build that didn ' t include that patch to install an engine</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">when the newer build starts up, a new engine exists that doesn ' t have an entry in the db, which leaves the blank slot in the array</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">to fix this, we should make sure that the resultant array from _buildsortedenginelist doesn ' t contain any undefined items.</Sentence>
