version: 3.4.0 (using kde kde 3.4.0) installed from: suse rpms as a newbie , i am often having to follow tutorials from *nix gurus on the web
some give permissions as rw-r--r--, some as 644, some as the two ways that konqueror gives it (permissions tab, and advanced permissions window from that tab)
the problem is that i have trouble translating [quickly] from numerical permissions (is there a term for that?) to what konqueror displays
i wish that konqueror would have the numerical permissions displayed right on the permissions tab, directly on the access permissions area of that tab
another bug mentioned that the user would want to edit/modify the permissions numerically, which i also think would be helpful
more choice is better
:) -thanks
