(*** this bug was imported into bugs.kde.org ***)
package: konqueror
version: 2.1
severity: wishlist
installed from: debian package 4:2.1.2-2 (testing/unstable)
compiler: gcc version 2.95.4.20010319 (debian prerelease)
os: linux 2.4.4 i686
to also change numerically the permits of the files on konqueror
for a lot of people it is easier and quick to change the permits of the files with the values chmod in numbers that to mark the stalls
i would be very happy if this option was included when making click in properties permits in a file with the konqueror
i think that under the options of the stalls it could have an option that allowed to insert the numeric values of the permits of the file.
i m here because i will report this wish too, but i will add one thing, when selecting the file permissions, the numerical number sould appear
it s nothing essencial, but it helps to complete kde
subject: [patch] #29984 change file permission using octal numbers
hello, i wrote a patch to close the feature requested in bug #29984 http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29984
the patch adds a line edit to the permission page of the properties dialog
the user can enter any octal number in the line edit to change the file permission like he would do when using chmod
additionally the file permissions selected by the user are shown as an octal number
the attached patch is tested against head and works flawlessly for me when applied to kdelibs
may i commit it
are there any comments for improvements

well, you are right
the string permission should be changed
i simply had no idea for a better, more descriptive string
maybe octal permissions would be better or chmod permissions

the additional widget might help the user to better understand the concept of unix permissions numbers, because the number is updated in real time, as soon as the user clicks on one of the checkboxes
maybe there is a possibility to make it more obvious to the user that s/he has not to change anything in this line edit
i can t think of any better way right now

we ll see what others think..

*** bug 106836 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
@peter: what do you think about this wish
could be interesting to implement it on dolphin?
@finex: the corresponding file where the change must be done is in kdelibs and out of scope of dolphin
from my point of view i m strongly against this feature
the file properties dialog is used by a lot of users (bug #185551 gives an indication about this)
adding a line editor to the ui that can be used and is understood by only by a very, very small user group should not be part of a ui that is used by other user groups too
i even don t see a benefit for the advanced users in this case
i think it is more effort to right click an item, select properties..., select permissions , fokus the line editor, type in the permissions instead of pressing f4 to open the konsole and type one line chmod...
ah, in the last sentence i meant i think it is not efficient to right click ..
sorry!
thanks peter
i agree with you
i ll move the request to kdelibs even if i m against too.
