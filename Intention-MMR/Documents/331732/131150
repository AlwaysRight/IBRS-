this bug was originally reported in the debian bts: http://bugs.debian.org/205976 when the currently playing song is deleted, rhythmbox should go onto the next song
created an attachment (id=58079) patch this patch fixed this by queuing a next operation when the playing song is deleted, rather than stopping.
with this patch it appears that upon a remove action, it always skips to the song at the top of the current list of songs in the library song list
this is ok only if you are deleting the first song in the place, it should skip to the song immediately below.
(in reply to comment #2) > only if you are deleting the first song in the place, it should skip to the > song immediately below
oops, should read: only if you are deleting the first song in the list, otherwise it should skip to the song immediately below
created an attachment (id=58382) fixed patch this now chooses the entry to play correctly.
works for me.
