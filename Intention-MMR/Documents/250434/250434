in version 4:4.5~20100903.1171290-1maemo1.1171237 when looking at a section of the calendar in which appointments are present, rendering is broken (e.g. does not update areas)
also, in this version i was never able to see an appointment (as red box, was possible previously).
also affects the new month view, also only when looking at a time range containing events
consistently happens on all devices with package installations, does not happen on my development phone with self-compiled applications, does also not happen on the desktop, making it very hard to debug
svn commit 1173789 by vkrause
disable opengl rendering for korg-mobile for now
it seems that the calendar views trigger a bad misbehavior in the opengl stack on the n900, causing random rendering defects at best and device crashes at worst
further details are still unknown, but not using opengl seems to make all those problems go away
