it would be nice if the synchronize view would support editor linking
here s the workflow i often use: 1
open many compare editors from sync view at once (because it takes long to load them due to slow connection)
review the changes in one compare editor 3
update (or commit) the changes
now, in order to do this: i have to manually find that file in the synchronize view because: - there s no editor linking - there is no navigate > show in > synchronize view - there is no action on the compare editor that would directly allow me to do this
sound reasonable to me, but just to clarify one thing: (in reply to comment #0) > - there is no action on the compare editor that would directly allow me to do this
by this you mean commit/update action avaliable in the compare editor s popup menu?

yes.
sounds the same as bug 219570, unless you want to keep this bug to improve the compare editor context menu.
(in reply to comment #3) > sounds the same as bug 219570, right, marking as a duplicate
