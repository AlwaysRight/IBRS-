i20080219-1124 due to low bandwidth i often start my update or commit work by clicking on several files in the synchronize view
this way other files load and comparison starts while i review the changes of the first file
now, my problem is that when i switch to another compare editor, the file is not automatically selected in the synchronize view
there are two feature i ' d like to see
add the synchronize view as ' show in ' target 2
add the commonly known ' link with editor ' tool bar button and/or view menu item

if i ' ve understood you correctly after you switch to another compare editor the several files you clicked on in the sync view are still selected
would you like to loose the selection

yes, exactly as it works in all other views that allow linking
i don ' t have > 1 selected as i clicked each of them to open the compare editor and hence only the last one was selected
> would you like them to have in both compare and non-compare editors
i ' m happy if it works with the compare editor but normally back-linking works for all editor parts.

due to style-guidelines 7.21 and 13.3 both features should be implemented.
created an attachment (id=148515) fix v01
patch that adds linking when sync ' ed using workspace model (i guess with models turned off it will work as well)
it ' s a working copy, so do not apply
it ' s still missing couple of things
* ishowintarget is not implemented yet
* linking doesn ' t work for editors that do not adapt to ifile.class
* only ifile or istorageeditorinput based elements are selected in the sync tree when linking, won ' t work for java workspace sync for instance

do you think that making the " link with editor " action enabled only for non-model or workspace model synchronizations is acceptable
for other types i would disable the action (for now) and file a separate bug to address it
this would make the fix, in it ' s current shape, available pretty soon.
> do you think that making the " link with editor " action enabled only for > non-model or workspace model synchronizations is acceptable
for me yes, and since it ' s limited scope i would probably not even add a toolbar button but simply add it to the view menu.
sounds good to me
and put it back on the toolbar with the other bug as soon as linking starts to work for all synchronizations (i.e. including models)?

sync view as " show in " target available in synchronize perspective.

yes, though i could also live without that button
i doubt people are going to toggle this frequently.

in other views like package-explorer i use this button frequently
so a button in view-toolbar would be useful
for first iteration a menu entry is admissible.
> in other views like package-explorer i use this button frequently
yes me too, but i guess i won ' t toggle it often in the sync view, e.g. i also never disable it in the history view
anyway, i also don ' t care if it ' s there by default
just make sure to put it into an action set so, that i can remove it.

forget this
action sets are only for the main toolbar.

this is an updated version of the patch that imo is ready to be committed
however, it ' s still missing bunch of things (see bug 291212, bug 291213, bug 291214, bug 291215) so if you think any of these is a no-go for this patch to be applied please let me know.
i have not tried the patch, but when i glanced though it, i didn ' t see any command id being used for the togglelinkingaction
iworkbenchcommandconstants.navigate_toggle_link_with_editor should be used as actiondefinitionid
in the package explorer, we handle activation in packageexploreractiongroup.setglobalactionhandlers(iactionbars).

created an attachment (id=148740) fix v04
added iworkbenchcommandconstants.navigate_toggle_link_with_editor as actiondefinitionid for togglelinkingaction.
> so if you think any of these is a no-go for this patch to > be applied please let me know
for me it ' s useless given the current limitations as
1. my main use case is to link from compare editor to view and not the other way around (not working due to bug 291213)
2. i use the old non-model based sync (bug 291215)
all right, at least i now know which bugs i should fix first
thanks for the comment.
created an attachment (id=149732) fix v05
final version of the patch to be committed simultaneously with fixes for bug 291215, bug 291214 and bug 291213.
applied to head, available in builds > n20091015-2000
bug 291213 no longer blocks this one.
verified in i20091027-0100
works great
remaining issue
the view menu action has not mnemonic (bug 293542 ).
