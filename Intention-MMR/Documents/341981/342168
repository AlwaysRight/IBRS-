after updating from (gecko/20060616 bonecho/2.0a3) to any build from 18th onwards the search engines disappear from the search field and manage search engines when pressed opens up the manage search engines list box but the buttons do not respond and the only way to close it is by pressing x

a way to work around this is to delete storage.sdb from your profile
it s unclear though why an old (corrupted?) storage.sdb file would cause this.
i confirm this bug
if you open the browser manually, the engines are there...
if you open the browser via clicking an external link from a different application, the engines are gone and the search manager is broken
