since bug 487245 landed, wheel scroll distance seems to have increased significantly on windows.
bug 501379 and this appear to be dups.
*** this bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 501379 ***
created attachment 386041 wheel scroll fix v1 my refactor patch in 487245 split the wheel scroll event handling out into an event handler, which introduced a bug where aretvalue was not set correctly
this patch addresses that and also adds some commenting to onwheelscroll to clearly explain what the handler does.
