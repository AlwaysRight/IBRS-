starting with today ' s trunk build (20090630), pages scroll further/faster than they did in the 20090629 build.
bug 493037 looks like a good candidate for causing this.
another symptom
if mouse wheel scrolling is set to a page at a time, the browser page will move to the top or bottom of the page
i have to use the scroll bar to move to anywhere other than the top or bottom of the page if the page is more that two screen heights long.

wheel fix
my refactor patch in 487245 split the wheel scroll event handling out into an event handler, which introduced a bug where aretvalue was not set correctly
this patch addresses that and also adds some commenting to onwheelscroll to clearly explain what the handler does.
this also appears on windows xp - mozilla/5.0 (windows
windows nt 5.1
en-us
rv: 1.9.2a1pre)
gecko/20090630 minefield/3.6a1pre (.net clr 3.5.21022)
this is extremely annoying
the middle-click-scroll speed is the same as it has always been, though.

a unittest for this would be great
(in reply to comment #9) > a unittest for this would be great
i was wondering the same thing, why didn ' t a unit test pick this up
maybe it ' s hard to do as mouse drivers are involved in defining scroll speeds.
this still seems to be happening in 3.6 alpha 1
i ' m running windows 7.

what you see is not this bug, but an intentional change in the scrolling behavior
see http://margaret.mit.edu/2009/08/making-firefox-feel-faster/ for more details (bug 462809).
