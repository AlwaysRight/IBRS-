build id: i20071213-1700 steps to reproduce: 1
open the new dynamic web project wizard 2
define a new runtime by pressing the new..
button in the target runtime group 3
after the runtime is defined, select the target runtime combo
notice that the new runtime is not in it
press cancel to exit the dialog
open the dialog again, the new runtime will now appear
more information:
what web project version (j2ee 1.2, 1.3, ...) are you creating in the wizard, and which runtime type (tomcat, ...) did you create
my initial guess would be that you created runtime that won t work with the project version you re creating and this is just a filtering problem when you launch the runtime creation from the project wizard.
it was for apache tomcat 5.5.23, using the default j2ee version (2.4)
notice that after i cancel out of the wizard, and open the wizard again, the runtime does appear in the dropdown..
so it s probably just a ui refresh issue.
