when creating a new webproject, i created a new runtime but i was unable to see in the drop down the newly created runtime
i then created a second one, i was then able to see the first one, but not the second newly created runtime
0. ensure you don ' t have any installed server (runtimes) defined
1. open the create new dynamyc web project wizard
2. enter the name for the web project
3. using the target runtime " new " button, create a new runtime
4. the runtime should be displayed in the combobox, but is not there

i was unable to reproduce this (using i20071221182137)
which runtime type were you using?
i was using tomcat 5.5
i just tried this again today using the latest build available (20080104023442), and i am still able to recreate the problem
the one thing i did noticed that i did is i skipped step 0, and instead added a step 2.1, where i just click on the drop down arrow of the target runtime (this way i ensure that there is nothing in the box), i then continue with step 3, using tomcat 5.5
reproduced the problem using tomcat 5.5
investigating now.
*** bug 214404 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
raising severity to major since this can be a pretty confusing regression for the user to deal with
whether this comes up or not depends on the implementation details of the server adapter
i can reproduce with tomcat, but not with weblogic.
created an attachment (id=86250) patch v1
i have a patch for this issue and bug 214375 (they are interconnected)
both issues appear to be fixed by the patch, but due to the size of the change, this will need further testing/review before being released.
fix released to the m5 code stream.
