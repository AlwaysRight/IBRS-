when creating a new webproject, i created a new runtime but i was unable to see in the drop down the newly created runtime
i then created a second one, i was then able to see the first one, but not the second newly created runtime
ensure you don t have any installed server (runtimes) defined 1
open the create new dynamyc web project wizard
enter the name for the web project 3
using the target runtime new button, create a new runtime 4
the runtime should be displayed in the combobox, but is not there
looks like you accidentally opened 2 copies of the same bug
