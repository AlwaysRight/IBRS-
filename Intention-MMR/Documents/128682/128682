open http://www.mozilla.org in one window
drag the logo banner at the top (a link to http://www.mozilla.org) into another window
the browser will try to load http://www.images.com/mozilla-banner.gif
dragging to an xterm instead will drop " images/mozilla-banner.gif "
this should obviously be dropping the absolute url of the link target, rather than the relative url for the image source
i ' m seeing it on 0301 linux, and daa confirmed it on 0302 win32
bad.
this is a 0.9.9-critical issue, imo
dragging and dropping of links is pretty important, and lots of links have images
(dragging non-image links seems to work fine, btw.)
linux cvs
dragging logo from this bug to a new window loaded http://mozilla.org/images/mozilla-banner.gif
dup of bug 128416?
actually, i bet this is a problem in nscontentareadragdrop
builddragdata, where we do
findparentnode(draggednode, ns_literal_string( " a " ).get(), getter_addrefs(linknode))
if ( linknode ) { *outisanchor = pr_true
getanchorurl(draggednode, urlstring)
createlinktext(urlstring, htmlstring, htmlstring)
} don ' t we want to do getanchorurl(linknode, urlstring)
so that we drag the url target
i ' ll try a patch in a bit.
yeah, that ' s money
taking, will attach patch shortly.

use linknode to fill urlstring if we ' re dragging image-within-link this works for me, and seems " obviously right "
soliciting quick reviews and approval for 0.9.9 and 1.0.
