dragging a link on an image to a tab results in that image being loaded, not the link it points to
dragging a text link to a tab loads the link as you would expect
this behaviour has changed in the recent nightly builds and this was a feature that i (used to) use a lot
reproducible: always steps to reproduce: 1
open a new tab
drag a link from an image to the tab
actual results: the image is loaded in the tabbed window
expected results: the link the image points to should be loaded.
confirmed win2k build 128416
drag the mozilla banner to a new tab at the top of this page
but this isnt only tabs, happens if you drag to a new window too need to move os-> all and component to browser-general
confirm win2k build 2002022503 rather :)
this doesn t seem limited to tabs, as i can can repro the problem with d n d ing an image link from one window to another
over to d n d for triage.
duping against bug with analysis and patch, higher-number though it may be
