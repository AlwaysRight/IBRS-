According to the javaDoc in Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String), this method has been deprecated and one should use the NLS class or the BundleFinder.find().
I was able to find the NLS class but I didn't find the BundleFinder class.
Is the javaDoc correct?
if it is a hint on where to find the BundleFinder class would help.
The NLS class doesn't seem to provide me with the same functionality that Platform.getResourceString does, so I am assuming that BundleFinder would do the job that I need.
Please provide me with more information on where to find the BundleFinder and improve the javaDoc.
I don't think that replacement functionality was ever implemented.
Pascal, you added bunch of comments like that to the Platform ver. 1.92.
As there are no current plans to act on them (and there has been no actions done in the last 2 years) I think we need to remove those comments - they make a rather confusing Javadoc.
There are 21 \"XXX\" comments that should be removed from Javadoc or acted upon.
Adding M7 as a milestone to remind to remove those comments.

So are you saying that the support for using getResourceString has just been droppped, and that no replacement will be available?
that concerns me because WTP has a code that uses this method, and I am sure that there is plenty of adopters that are currently using that function as well.
The method Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String) is not deprecated at this time;
the comments should have been added to the implementation code or to a bug report, not to the Javadoc of the Platform class.
Please adjust the target milestone, so it does not point at a closed milestone in the past.
From bug 247983 other tagged methods:
-getResourceBundle(Bundle)
-getResourceString(Bundle, String)
-getResourceString(Bundle, String, ResourceBundle)

Removed incorrect comments from the Platform class.
We collided, I just made the same changes.
The only difference is that I moved the comments to InternalPlatform.
Also I deprecated Platform#endSplash since this has been replaced with IApplicationContext#applicationRunning().
