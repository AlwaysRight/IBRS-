For some time (2 months? more?, i don't remember) i have this problem:
--&gt; if i drag and drop a folder from a location to an other, cpu use for thunderbird process is more than 50%.
--&gt; Even if the folder is empty
--&gt; It occurs with subfolder move inside Local Folders
--&gt; It occurs with folder move inside a pop account (for example moving Inbox-&gt;test to Draft-&gt;test
--&gt; It DOESN'T occurs when moving a folder from a pop account to an other (for example moving AccoutA --&gt; Inbox --&gt; test to AccountB --&gt; Inbox --&gt;test ... Butin this case, by design, folder is copied, not moved --&gt; it seems that this is
the delete which is the problem
Other Facts
============
- Memory doesn't change during the move time ... only a high level of cpu use
- Delete key or Right-click delete (so move to trash) got the same bad result
- Renaming a folder take a long time too
- Checking pop account take more resources than before ... 10 to 20\" of high cpu resource for checking mail, slowing a lot of windows applications
- Same thing for RSS folders ...
Hardware and Software information
=================================
Computer: Dell Latitude D820 laptop, Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 2Go Ram, 100Go HD 7200rpm
OS: Windows Vista Business
Thunderbird: TB nightly 2.0.0.10pre (2007111403) ... but problem occurs since long time
Profile: profile.ini modified to have the profile files on D:\\Thunderbird\\JMR.profil.
All emails account store on D:\\Thunderbird\\ (13 pop account + 69 RSS feeds)
D:\\Thunderbird: 2.3Go
Bigger file: 384Mo
Configuration: each pop has its own folder (inbox, etc ...) but rules filters lot of mails to subfolder in local folder directory
I've check bugzilla for similar bug, event Mozillazine forum, but never seen something like this
Additional information: Running in safe mode: same problem
ohoh ... thus bug seems related to my 10000 temp files in temp folder: tmprules-xxx.dat
I've deleted all of them --&gt; filters works again AND this bug seems solved by removing them
bad news: new tmprules begin to appairs ...
So, this bug is a dup of bug 362539

I guess the really low perf behaviour was coming that TB parsed all 10000 rules files for all received mail ...
same thing when moving a folder, it parsed the 10000 rules files to see if these have to be updated after the move

This bug is not a duplicate of bug 362539.
Reason:
1) Although the underlying cause may be the same, the symptoms of the two bugs are very different.
2) Since the description attached to bug 362539 does not include the symptoms of this bug, it does not properly include this reported problem.
3) When users search for this problem, now that this bug is closed, they probably will not find this description.
Nor will they find bug 362539 since it does not include these symptoms at the top level.
Hence they will not find the circumvention.
4) Therefore, please re-open this bug report.
5) Please do not attempt to amend the description of bug 362539.
Please leave that decision, as well as that of closure, to one of the Bugzilla 'monitors'
who will know whether that is appropriate and, if so, how to do it cleanly, without obscuring user access to information.
you're right ...
this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe
