version: (using devel) installed from: compiled sources i would like to see: - fit to window (zoom in smaller and zoom out larger images) - fit only larger images to window - fit to width - fit to height - fit window to image - actual/original size and configurable key shortcut for every mode.
i think it s a bit too much, so i won t add that much zoom options
note however that there are past and coming improvements which brings some of the functionality you are asking for
- fitting smaller image to window is bug #137982
- when you zoom in and out with the (+) and (-) actions, gwenview now snaps to the zoom to width and zoom to height ratios when it comes across them
*** this bug has been marked as a duplicate of 137982 ***
why do you think it s a bit too much
irfanview, a popular image viewer for windows which i often use, has all this options and i don t see any reason why gwenview shouldn t have them.
i believe it would clutter the application for little outcome
as i said, part of what you are asking is already there or will be soon
i don t think most users have a need for so many zoom options.
it is interesting that this clutter doesn t bother irfanview userbase (which is larger than gwenview userbase)
ah..
i understand now, this is part of the global effort to reduce clutter in kde by reducing features and making it a gnome clone
at least then add actual size action with configurable shortcut as in old gwenview
regards!
actual action is already in gwenview 2.0, and you can configure its shortcut
thanks for the sarcasm.
where is the zoom to width option
using 2.9.1
