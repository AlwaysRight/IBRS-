when i update today (0708) from yesterday ' s nightly, i get to download the new build, but after restart it doesn ' t apply anything (no patching window comes up, no messages on the console or js console)
i tried running updater.app by hand as well, and didn ' t get anything
active-update.xml

not sure if this is just the server being mistaken about there being newer builds for me, or what, but i thought i ' d file it.
i ' m still seeing this
after i restart, the update archive gets deleted, but i never get the " updating firefox " window, and the build is the same old one
is there some kind of logging i can turn on?
mano tells me that this got fixed two days ago, but i can ' t find a duplicate bug tracking that fix
at any rate, as of at least 2005-07-20 builds, this works now.
point is, i ' m not aware of any mac-swu fix which was landed in that time frame (and i was able to reproduce this issue until two days ago or so).
i was apparently a little premature in filing this as worksforme
what i ' m seeing now is that the update applies *once*, and then subsequent updates do not get applied
is active-update.xml supposed to be deleted after the update is applied
if so, that ' s the problem, since it ' s still there after an update
1. get a day-before-today-nightly build
2. check for updates
3. restart & apply updates
4. look in deer park.app/contents/macos/
5. check for updates again tomorrow (or modify the app.update.url to fake a previous build number by switching %build_id% to " 0 " and check today!)
6. restart & apply updates
7. notice that they ' re not applied
you ' ll see the active-update.xml ..
i ' ll attach the one that was lying around in mine.

active-update.xml that was left around after applying updates
nominating for 1.8b4 blocker
i just tried updating from a freshly downloaded 7/28 build to the 7/29 build on my mac, and it worked
however, i also see that active-updates.xml is still in the application directory after the update
i also see an active-updates.xml file under windows, but its contents are significantly different (just an empty xml tag).

hm
i just tried removing active-updates.xml and that didn ' t seem to help
in fact, i can ' t seem to find the .mar file from the second update cycle anywhere on my hdd.
i ' ve been using the auto update feature for the last week
strangely it has been working on alternate days
updates for the 24/7, 26/7 and 28/7 versions of deer park were all fine.

it occurred to me the other day, but i wanted to be sure
my experience seems to indicate dp can only be updated once
day one
download nightly .dmg, day two
update it the next day via updates mechanism, day 3
download via updates mechanism fails to overwrite
i ' m guessing something is being written somewhere to prevent further updates
i ' ve also tried scouring my hard drive for any signs of firefox-1.0+.en-us.mac.mar after a failed update and their doesn ' t appear to be any sign

the file is actually downloaded to update.mar.
when i hit this problem today, i noticed that the updates/0/ folder contained a copy of updater.app
there was nothing else left in the folder
when i deleted the entire updates/ folder, the problem went away, and i was able to update from the 7/29 build to today ' s 8/1 build
adding this to my bug list.
(in reply to comment #12) > adding this to my bug list
thanks for the tip darin, i ' ll keep an eye open for it
i successfully updated this morning after grabbing a nightly yesterday
i notice two updater.app ' s in deerpark.app
one in deerpark.app/contents/macos, and another in deerpark.app/contents/macos/updates/0/updater.app
is this correct/normal or expected?
from the javascript console " error:[exception.." component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (ns_error_failure) [nsifile.remove] " nsresult: " 0x80004005 (ns_error_failure) "
location: " js frame::file:///applications/deerpark.app/contents/macos/components/nsupdateservice.js::cleanupupdatesdir::line 318 " data: no]
source file:
file:///applications/deerpark.app/contents/macos/components/nsupdateservice.js line: 318
" line 318 is " updatedir.remove(false)

yeah, i think it ' s having trouble removing updates/0/updater.app/ because it does not expect that to be a directory
under other systems (linux and windows), it is not a directory
it is a simple executable
the solution is probably to change nsupdateservice.js to pass |true| to the nsifile
remove method.
