go to twitter.com, enter a dummy username, click login
page starts to load, some content is shown, and the device locks up (mouse won t move).
seems to be working for me, both for a valid login credentials & invalid ones
i just rebuilt today.
i don t get a crash on this site, but every time i log into twitter the browser freezes
this happens with the latest 20090727 vlad put it both on my unit and the one in tchung s cube.
still seeing this with a current build
a couple of times it hung loading the front page, but that might be something else (reloading it repeatedly didn t seem to trigger the hang)
the hang after login appear to happen right around the time it switches to ssl mode..
i see the site identity button turn blue, but the hangs before a favicon shows up
this appears to hang the device hard..
the kernel debugger doesn t seem to notice anything happens, and i can t break or get a list of threads/processes after the hang.
bug might be a dupe of this too.
i can t reproduce this in this local build that i just did, which has a fix for bug 508113 in it.
alas, i still get the hang on my oban board with the 504970 patch.
