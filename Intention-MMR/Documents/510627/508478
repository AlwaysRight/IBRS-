+++ this bug was initially created as a clone of bug #506722 +++ this could be a dupe of bug 506722
please dupe if so
when accessing http://addons.mozilla.org, the site and os will hang up
system reboot required
str: 1) install tegra build
mozilla/5.0 (windows windowsce 6.0 en-us rv:1.9.2a1pre) gecko/20090804 minefield/3.6a1pre
2) launch amo
3) start typing in the search text box
4) system hang.
further, i noticed that when the device hangs, and then the device is rebooted, there is no keyboard or touchpad activity
you need to restart the entire device a second time to get keyboard and touchpad activity back.
i know for a fact that amo used to work just fine
so either something changed in recent os/browser builds, or something changed on amo (eg bug 508408?).
