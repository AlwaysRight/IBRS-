happens with at least the following jhbuild gnome 2.14 modules
gedit, zenity, file-roller, rhythmbox traceback (most recent call last)
make[2]: *** [es/rhythmbox.xml] fehler 1
make[2]: verlasse verzeichnis ?/cvs/gnome/rhythmbox/help?
<kmaraas> nazgul, i got the same problem as you in gnome-panel
and i found that if i continued the build outside of jhbuild it passed (or it could be that running it a second time would make it pass too, but i didn t check that)
a second run does not change anything i acknowledge
it compiles for me as well using the system-wide xml2po
playing with python_path environment variable did not remedy.
got the same for gnome-applet, gedit and perhaps more with jhbuild is smth changed in xml2po
last week it was working correctly..
i have no system wide xml2po and playing with the environment fix nothing

fix handling of untranslated translators-credits
yes, something has changed in xml2po (we allow marking of untranslated strings now, it was a recent bugfix, and this introduced a problem with untranslated translator-credits )
please commit this for me (i don t have my ssh key here)

* modes/docbook.py: check if translators-credits is translated
note to self: add more regression tests involving docbook mode and real data.
