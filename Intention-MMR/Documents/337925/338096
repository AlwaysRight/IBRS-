while generating docs with a language where the translator-credits string is empty, it breaks:
some debugging shows that xml2po fetches the contents of the gettext string translator-credits to get the string with translators
however, when this empty, for example in gnome-panel/help/clock/de/de.po: #
put one translator per line, in the form of name <email>, year1, year2
#: ../c/legal.xml:0(none) msgid translator-credits msgstr it breaks, because a none object is returned instead of a string
then, the currentxmlmode.postprocessxmltranslation breaks because it tries to do a nonetype.split
as shown in the error above.
btw, it s weird that this doesn t happen overall
am i the first
maybe it s some ubuntu dapper python bug..
can anyone tell?
created an attachment (id=63245) proposed fix to check if translators is not none
this patch fixes it on my automated build system with jhbuild on ubuntu dapper.
hmm, could also be a gettext bug
maybe it shouldn t even get none.
hmm the older report has a simple fix that was just committed and fixes the problem
no idea if your patch could be useful as well
*** this bug has been marked as a duplicate of 337925 ***
ah right, thanks
that fix was a tiny bit nicer indeed
thanks!
