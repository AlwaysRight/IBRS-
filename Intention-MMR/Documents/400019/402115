if you double-click the places star button, the edit bookmarks popup comes up
if you use the menulist to pick a directory, the popup goes away, but it should wait until the user clicks done or delete
reproducible: always
confirming
the first time i click on the menu list drop down button (within the bookmark popup) it opens and i see all the choices
the second time i click on it, the menu list closes, but so does the popup.
i m using mozilla/5.0 (windows windows nt 5.1 en-us rv:1.9a9pre) gecko/2007110112 minefield/3.0a9pre
i haven t tried mac os x yet.
yes, what seth said in comment #1: contrary to the initial bug description, i can actually pick a directory without it closing the popup
in the bug description, s/if you use the menulist to pick a directory/if you open and close the menulist without picking/

bug 451915 - move firefox/places bugs to firefox/bookmarks and history
remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string places-to-b-and-h
in thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows: tools | message filters make sure the correct account is selected
click new conditions: body contains places-to-b-and-h change the action to delete message
select manually run from the dropdown at the top
click ok
select the filter in the list, make sure inbox is selected at the bottom, and click run now
this should delete all the bugspam
you can then delete the filter
