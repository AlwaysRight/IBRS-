by right-clicking then bookmark this page or by clicking the star, the small dialogue that comes up will close the down arrow next to folder (not the far right one, the one next to the input box) clicked twice
reproducible: always steps to reproduce: 1
actual results: the whole dialogue closes
expected results: just the drop down box to close/collapse
this is on default theme.

if not, sorry bout that.

bug 403711 was duped to bug 400019, so i assume this one should also point to the parent

bug 451915 - move firefox/places bugs to firefox/bookmarks and history
remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string places-to-b-and-h
in thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows: tools | message filters make sure the correct account is selected
click new conditions: body contains places-to-b-and-h change the action to delete message
select manually run from the dropdown at the top
click ok
select the filter in the list, make sure inbox is selected at the bottom, and click run now
this should delete all the bugspam
you can then delete the filter
