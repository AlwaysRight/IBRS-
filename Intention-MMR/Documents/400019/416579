when i go to add bookmark, the menu comes up
if i click on the folder drop-down box, but then i click elsewhere on the menu without making a selection, the menu just closes
reproducible: always steps to reproduce: 1.bookmarks => bookmark this page 2.select the folder drop-down box 3.click somewhere else on the bookmark menu without making a selection on the drop-down box
actual results: the toolbar disappears, and you must reopen it
expected results: the drop-down box should disappear with the bookmark toolbar still active
the toolbar also closes if you click anywhere else on the screen.
