steps to reproduce
click star icon on address bar
open the menulist
click the bookmarks panel
the menulist should close but the panel should stay open i think this might be a windows only regression
the fix here seems to be to remove the extra check for wm_activate in nswindow::eventisinsidewindow
that supposedly will break bug 45108 but i don ' t see that happening.

changing os to windows, since we know it happens there
if it really does happen on mac, we should change os to all
seeking blocking (as i sought it for bug #402115)
mconnor and beltzner feel this is an important blocker for 1.9

use a activateapp here instead
this patch fixes this bug as well as bug 390197
the change is to some code that was added by bug 45108 when windows+m is pressed to minimize all windows while hovering over the menu
this code skipped checking if the event occured over a popup for the wm_activate event
instead, we ' ll use the wm_activateapp event.

this is a readable version of the patch
is there a better reviewer here?
maybe dougt might want to check this patch too?

ere should review this also
you can comment out / remove the windows ce part of this
there is no way to test this on the mozilla 1.9 trunk yet (wince doesn ' t build yet)
when i get windows ce working again, i will investigate.

neil, did you check that there are no ill effects if config.trim_on_minimize is on?

+ on the wince part.
dougt, did you mean the patch is ok as is, or to remove the windows ce part entirely
ere, i don ' t see anything different happening with that pref set, either visibly or to memory use
the code being changed only gets executed when a popup is open though
is there a specific case you were thinking might be a problem?
you can do either -- when wince is building again on trunk, i can look at this
(hopefully in a few weeks).

nevermind about the pref. r=me

patch as 3 reviews is it possible to land ?
yes, but i won ' t have access to windows for a bit, so someone else should do it.
neil, what should be done
running a build with the patch and have tests
if i understand it right and no-one can build it on windows we could use the tryserver therefor?
there is no means of creating tests for this currently, it requires native messages to be sent
testing involves making sure this and bug 390197 are fixed
i ' m not too worried about that though
i just won ' t be able to fix any problems that occur if the evil test machine fails.
if someone sends me a build i can test it...
we ' re not actually looking for someone to test it, but it would still be useful
we ' re looking for someone to check it in and be able to monitor the tinderbox afterwards.
checking in widget/src/windows/nswindow.cpp
/cvsroot/mozilla/widget/src/windows/nswindow.cpp,v < -- nswindow.cpp new revision: 3.723
previous revision: 3.722 done
neil, we have the correct behavior now
but i see another problem which seems to be raised by this patch
when i click on the menulist the complete name field is highlighted
it is reverted when closing the menulist again
should i file a new bug for that issue
i don ' t think that is expected.
(in reply to comment #26) > should i file a new bug for that issue
you should always file new bugs.
