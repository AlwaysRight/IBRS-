when using the star icon to add a bookmark or when using the bookmark this page menu item, the ui for adding a bookmark is dismissed/disappears without saving the bookmark
the line for folders had 2 drop down boxes
clicking on the first (bold arrow) brings up the most recent folders (i assume) if i do not like the options and click the arrow again, the entire dialog box disappears
clicking anywhere causes the box to disappear
once the arrow is clicked upon, doing anything other than selecting one of the folders causes the box to be dismissed
reproducible: always steps to reproduce: 1.press ctrl-d to bookmark page 2.click first arrow in folder selection box 3.click anywhere else within the add bookmark dialog box 4.dialog box disappears actual results: dialog box disappears with no bookmark saved expected results: drop down list should close with no changes
this is a dup, sorry for not having the dup bug # handy.

i can t find other dupes, so confirming this atm since it has valid steps to reproduce there is bug 393948 but it s about clicking elsewhere in the browser, not on the dialog itself
yeah, make sure not to close this one, because they closed mine as a dupe of it, even though mine was the earlier reporting
i don t care about that, though, just as long as it gets fixed!
this doesn t reproduce in the current nightly build
mozilla/5.0 (macintosh intel mac os x 10.5 en-us rv:1.9b2pre) gecko/2007112104 minefield/3.0b2pre
if i open the add bookmark dialog, open the select dropdown (not the arrow for expansion) and then click elsewhere in the dialog, it just closes the select folder dropdown, not the add dialog.
still valid here, i can clearly reproduce
mozilla/5.0 (windows windows nt 5.1 en-us rv:1.9b2pre) gecko/2007112106 minefield/3.0b2pre
my mistake
this is windows only
i ve confirmed it in mozilla/5.0 (windows windows nt 5.1 en-us rv:1.9b2pre) gecko/2007112106 minefield/3.0b2pre.
i wonder if the select box arrow really should exist in the add bookmark dialog, given the amount of times that i click mistakenly on the wrong arrow, with this bug as irritating consequence :)
neil, johnath: is this related to your click-to-dismiss-panels work?
*** bug 406207 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
should the summary be changed to ...when not selecting a folder
ps apparently a mid-air collision added gamesonline10 to the cc list in my name
i ll leave it there on the assumption the addition was intended, but i ll decline the credit.
(in reply to comment #9) > neil, johnath: is this related to your click-to-dismiss-panels work
this involves weird interaction between a dismissible widget (the combo box) *within* a dismissible widget (the bookmark panel) which is different than the problem i was having, but it does still sound like consume-rollup-event foo, so neil might have useful input.

bug 451915 - move firefox/places bugs to firefox/bookmarks and history
remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string places-to-b-and-h
in thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows: tools | message filters make sure the correct account is selected
click new conditions: body contains places-to-b-and-h change the action to delete message
select manually run from the dropdown at the top
click ok
select the filter in the list, make sure inbox is selected at the bottom, and click run now
this should delete all the bugspam
you can then delete the filter
