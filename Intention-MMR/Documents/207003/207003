created an attachment (id=80836) failing test case
having bug 199846 released we can now use the fuzz factor
currently, after calculating the fuzz factor has been done, the result will be used when applying the patch
the problem is that the result can represent a bigger value than we actually need for some hunks
this in combination with shifting can result in invalid hunks being applied
in order to fix the issue, we should consider remembering the fuzz factor for each individual hunk (e.g. as a field in hunkresult class)
i hope the attached test case illustrates the problem better than my description.
the idea with the fuzz factor for each hunk is the way
it is one of our priorities now.
created an attachment (id=84655) patch
patch that changes matching strategy so now a fuzz factor is set and used individually for each hunk
moreover, the fuzz factor entered in the patch preview wizard is now treated as a maximum fuzz factor for applying a patch (calculating the fuzz for each hunk)
ps
i ' ve also smuggled some polished comments.

" can ' t find the fuzz " test case
test case showing that by default the guess button only tries to find the fuzz factor less or equal to the maximum_fuzz_factor (2)
the fuzz required by the patch to be applied is 3.
the patch and both test cases released to head.
