version: 0.9.11 (using kde kde 3.2.2) installed from: compiled from sources os: linux when you select the disk label of a data cd project, the f2 key should have the same effect as double clicking on it: rename
this will make it more consistent with konqueror s file renaming shortcut, which is also the f2 key.
there is another inconsistency with konqueror s renaming behavior: when you have edited the name and select another widget without pressing enter first, the editing action is aborted
in konqueror, the edit action is confirmed and executed by unselecting the icon that the user was editing
the only way to abort editing the name is by pressing esc, which makes sense to me.
