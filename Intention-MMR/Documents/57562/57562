version: 1.5.1 (using kde kde 3.1.1a)
installed from: suse rpms
os: linux
i just upgraded from kde 3.1.0 to 3.1.1.a
now i am not able to create a new mail folder on my imap account
all the folders i create end up in the local mail tree
in the dialog box the button belongs to only offers top level which apparently is the local mail tree
no choice for the imap account is given
this is also true if i want to generate subfolders of any already existing folders on the imap account
i had no problems like this prior to upgrading to 3.1.1a
it definitely works in the current 3_1_branch
subject: re: cannot create mail folder in imap account
it definitely does not work using kdenetwork3-3.1.1-45 biuld on 02 april 2003 by suse

i m pretty sure that it s a suse only problem (they want to prevent the user from trying to move a local folder to an imap account)
please report the bug to them

yes, it s a suse patch
because originally you could move folders to nirvana when changing the belongs option of local folders to a imap location
i m not sure how to fix that ;(
what are the chances of having the real bug fixed for 3.1.2
then suse could take out that workaround
is there a bug report already for the real bug

subject: re: cannot create mail folder in imap account
the chances for having a real bug fix for 3.1.2 are pretty good since i just committed carsten s patch
for 3.2 i have cleaned up kmfolderdia.cpp quite a bit
there s still a minor problem which prevents me from committing it to head

did you also upgrade kdenetwork3-mail (which contains kmail)
kdenetwork3 only contains a few libraries used by some of the kde network applications

*** bug 59956 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
hi, i can confirm that the bug still exists with the following suse packages installed
kdenetwork3-query-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-lan-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-vnc-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-devel-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-chat-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-lisa-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-news-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-mail-3.1.2-7 kdenetwork3-dialup-3.1.2-7
as i remember i had no problem creating imap folders with the original kde 3.1.1 packages from suse 8.2 greetings, joerg
