i20060110-1026 i can no longer click some elements in the packages view and suddenly the label gets corrupted into" org.ec.."
test case
1. start attached workspace
2. select project ' foo ' in the package explorer
3. select ' org.eclipse.jface.text ' in the packages view
3. expand ' foo ' in the package explorer
4. select ' src ' == > strange label " org.ec..
this works with i200605-0800 plus jdt ' s build input for i20060110-1026
created an attachment (id=32846) test workspace
this used to happen back in the 3.0 days (bug 56593) when we explicitly set the font on a particular item...
moving to swt since this looks like a regression at the swt level
i did not change anything related to labels recently.
boris, i saw that a new labledecorator got added with i20060110-1026
i don ' t know the details about it but thought it might be related.
tod, could it be that this was caused by the patch from bug 121623?
no i wouldn ' t think so - bug 121623 is just a way of passing context but it doesn ' t change how decoration is done
any update on this one?
ping.
would you be able to send me a screenshot of the bug
i opened your workspace with the latest built (20060118-1600) and i don ' t get the strange label problem you do
thanks.

i opened your workspace > with the latest built (20060118-1600) sure, but as far as i know the latest build is i20060131-1200
here my steps again
1. download eclipse sdk build i20060131-1200 for windowsxp
2. extract the attached workspace to c:
3. start eclipse using -data c:\tmp == > picture 1
4. execute step 2 to 4 from comment 0 == > picture 2
created an attachment (id=33926) picture 1
created an attachment (id=33927) picture 2
thanks for the screenshots
you were right, the labels are appearing strange
it seems to be modifying the name that was last selected before clicking on another view
note:Also tested with Version: 3.1.1, Build id: M20050929-0840 and the bug is not present.

mmh, i never said it didn ' t work there, did i
i first saw the bug in i20060110-1026, as indicated in comment 0
once the dots appear i often can ' t select the top item any longer.
no you did not, we usually add comments to the bug to save time for the person that is fixing it.
*** bug 124850 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
we already had something like that in bug 54057, which has probably been solved by the fix for bug 57426
could it be that the support for background images has a similarly adverse effect as the support for fonts had?
yes, there have been many changes since 3.1.x.
i have a handle on this one
it was caused by the fix for bug 117700.
actually, it turned out to be caused by the fix for bug 119207.
fixed > 20060215 vi, we should consider this for m5.
*** bug 127838 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug ***
verified in 3.2 m5 (i20060217-1115).
