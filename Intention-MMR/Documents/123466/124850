i20060119-0800 in recent builds i occasionally see tableitems that are cut at the end (end in an ellipsis) when the item is selected
as soon as i remove the selection for the item, the full label appears again (see screenshot)
i guess this is something like bug 54057, which has probably been solved by the fix for bug 57426.
created attachment 33457 screenshot
duplicate of bug 123466?
