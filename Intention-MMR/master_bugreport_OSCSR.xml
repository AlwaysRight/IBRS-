<Sentence ID="8.8">the high-priority (132) process thread normally has a very low cpu user-time total (ie, it doesn ' t actually do much), and the main firefox thread (where we actually do almost everything) accumulates cpu user-time as it ' s used</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.9">but in the hang conditions, the high-priority thread accumulates cpu rapidly while all the other threads ' counters stay frozen</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="5.3">&gt; &gt; &gt; i think understanding unix &gt; &gt; permissions is confusing as is, but allowing for setting the octal mode &gt; &gt; would just add another widget to the general confusion</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.4">this would seem &gt; &gt; roughly like being prompted for command line switches when dragging and &gt; &gt; dropping a file because it s more powerful that way</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.5">&gt; the additional widget might help the user to better understand the concept of &gt; unix permissions numbers, because the number is updated in real time, as soon &gt; as the user clicks on one of the checkboxes</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.6">maybe there is a possibility to &gt; make it more obvious to the user that s/he has not to change anything in this &gt; line edit</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.1">@finex: the corresponding file where the change must be done is in kdelibs and out of scope of dolphin</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.2">from my point of view i m strongly against this feature</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.3">the file properties dialog is used by a lot of users (bug #185551 gives an indication about this)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.4">adding a line editor to the ui that can be used and is understood by only by a very, very small user group should not be part of a ui that is used by other user groups too</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.5">i even don t see a benefit for the advanced users in this case</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.6">i think it is more effort to right click an item, select properties..., select permissions , fokus the line editor, type in the permissions instead of pressing f4 to open the konsole and type one line chmod...</Sentence>
